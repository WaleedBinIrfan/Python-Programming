    "# It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden\n",
    "# Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
